										<h3>Project : Glass Buildings</h3>
										<p>
											Whether it’s mirrored to reflect light or frosted to diffuse it, etched with intricate designs or bubbled to playfully distort vision, glass offers not only a relief from obstinate, opaque materials but an opportunity to infuse a building’s façade with fluidity in a way that no other material can. Here, Architectural Digest takes a look at 11 notable buildings and architects that have adeptly used glass to propose a new vision of nonresidential spaces that exist not just to function but to inspire.

									<p> 
										A project consists of a concrete and organized effort motivated by a perceived opportunity when facing a problem, a need, a desire or a source of discomfort. It seeks the realization of a unique and innovative deliverable, such as a product, a service, a process, or in some cases, a scientific research. Each project has a beginning and an end, Section 1.2 and as such is considered a closed dynamic system.

										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2023</span></h4>
										<p>
											The notable 19th-century architect of skyscrapers, Louis Sullivan, promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: "Form follows function". 
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2023</span></h4>
										<p>
											While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of "function" in place of Vitruvius' "utility". 
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2022</span></h4>
										<p>
											"Function" came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of <br />a building, not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2022</span></h4>
										<p>
											Nunzia Rondanini stated, Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects <br />that it has in common with other <br />human sciences. 
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2022</span></h4>
										<p>
											Through its own particular way of expressing values, architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and <br />of itself, it will promote social development....
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2021</span></h4>
										<p>
											"it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality <br />which degrades form into a mere instrumentality".
										</p>

									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2021</span></h4>
										<p>
											Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are Rationalism, Empiricism, Structuralism, Poststructuralism, Deconstruction and Phenomenology.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h4>The Project<br />of Architect For the <span>2021</span></h4>
										<p>
											In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those<br /> included in the compass of both structure and function, <br />the consideration of sustainability, hence sustainable architecture.

								<h2>2023<br />Web Developer Awards<br />Winner</h2>
								<hr class="bar" />
								<p>
									A prize is an award to be given to a person or a group of people to recognize and reward their actions and achievements. Official prizes often involve monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are also associated with extravagant awarding ceremonies, such as the Academy Awards.<br />
									Prizes are also given to publicize noteworthy or exemplary behaviour, and to provide incentives for improved outcomes and competitive efforts. In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy.
